        <h2>Power Pod Reviews</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="reviewer">John Smith on 2/22/2020</p>
          <p class="review">
            Just got my Power Pod. It is nice and small and very lightweight. I
            charged it all night and today I used it to charge my iPhone when it
            got down to 10%. The Power Pod only charged my phone to 40% before
            losing its' power. I was hoping to get a full charge but 40% is
            better than a dead phone, I guess. In an emergency it would keep
            your phone going but doesn't seem to have enough capacity for a full
            charge for your phone.
